### **What is an Option Premium?**
It’s the price you pay (or receive) to buy (or sell) an option. Think of it as the cost of having the "right" but not the "obligation" to trade a stock.

---

### **What Determines the Premium?**
There are two main parts:

#### **1. Intrinsic Value (Real Value Now)**  
- This is how much the option would be worth **if exercised immediately**.  
  - Example for a **Call Option** (buy the stock):  
    If the stock price is $120 and the strike price is $100, the intrinsic value = $20.  
    If the stock price is $90, the intrinsic value = $0 (because it’s not worth buying at $100).  

---

#### **2. Time Value (Potential Future Value)**  
- This reflects the **possibility** that the option could become more valuable before it expires.  
- It depends on:
  - **Volatility**: How much the stock price is expected to move. More movement = higher time value.
  - **Time to Expiration**: More time = higher chance of a favorable move.
  - **Demand**: If lots of people want the option, its price goes up.

---

### **Key Takeaway**
The premium = Intrinsic Value + Time Value.  
Even if the intrinsic value is $0, the time value might still make the option expensive.

---

### **Simple Example**
Imagine a call option:
- **Stock Price**: $120  
- **Strike Price**: $100  
- **Time to Expiration**: 1 month  
- **Volatility**: High (stock moves a lot)  

The premium might be $25:  
- $20 from intrinsic value (stock is already $20 above strike).  
- $5 from time value (price might rise further in a month).
